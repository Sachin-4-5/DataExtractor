# DataExtractor

## 📖 Overview  
DataExtractor is a lightweight, extensible .NET Framework 4.7.2 console application designed to extract data from SQL Server databases using dynamic connection and query configuration defined in an external XML template. It exports the result into CSV or Excel files and logs the process for auditing and debugging purposes.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Dynamic Configuration via XML: DB conn, query, o/p format, and path are defined in template.xml. <br />
✅ Data Export Support: CSV and Excel (via EPPlus Library). <br />
✅ Logs info/debug/error messages to a configurable file path (via app.config). <br />
✅ Secure and Configurable: No hardcoded credentials, externalized configuration. <br />
✅ Command Line Integration: Accepts XML template path as a runtime argument. <br />
